# prework-study-guide


## Description


My motivation for creating this study guide was to create a resource for me to refer back to during this course and to build upon as I learn more about coding. I built this project so that all the information I would need on Javascript, CSS, HTML, and Git would be accessible in one place.
Instead of having to search for each topic individually I will be able to locate them all easily in one place. In the process of creating this study guide I learned how to use the command line in Git Bash. I learned how to create a Git Hub repository and set up SSH keys on my computer. I also learned how to save my work and complete the Git flow.
